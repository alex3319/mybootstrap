# Bootstrap Scaffold
Read this documentation before starting the project.

## Important
Change `pkg.name` from `package.json` and `bower.json` to your *project name*.  
It will be used as your project css and js file names in Gruntfile.  
Change `build:css` and `build:js` file names same as `pkg.name`.  
Replace with your project name or remove `name` from `data.json`. It's just a placeholder.
